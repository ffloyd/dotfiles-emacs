* Emacs configuration ideas

  * [ ] make linter work on init files without hakery like ~(defvar something)~
    * creating ~a-common.el~ with ~require~'s of the all wide-used packeges may help
    * additional helpers from ~general.el~ (~:ghook~, ~:gfhook~, ~general-setq~) may help reduce linter warnings
    * DoD:
      * 0 warnings when linting files
      * lefthook pre-commit linter check
      * optional: Github action
  * [ ] make LSP menu present only when LSP mode is enabled
  * [ ] integrte reliable folding solution
    * should work for:
      * Ruby
      * Elixir
      * JS/TS
      * Markdown
  * [ ] typesript / TSX support
    * test on SchedQL repo
